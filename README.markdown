#LongingFastForward

![Installation visualisation](installation-inside-w300.png)

This is the software for an Artistic Research Station that will run on the Northwestern Coast of Greenland. This art project is called 'Longing Fast Forward'.

It will control and run four high-end cameras to construct a panoramic one year dynamic timelapse, by syncronising four macs equipped with four cameras. 

Visit the [Longing Fast Forward homepage](http://longing.gl) to follow the project.
